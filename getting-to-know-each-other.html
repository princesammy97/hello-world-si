<p class="p3">Hi, my name is Sam Inkaya.
I lived in Plainfield, IL most of my life. I attended Plainfield High School and went to JJC for a while afterwards.
I like to lift, going out with friends and family, watching Netflix, and playing video games here and there. 
I come from a small family.I have one brother. I am majoring in Cybersecurity to become a Information Security Analyst full time.

<p class="p4">
   My favorite hobby is lifting. I work out each part of my body. I used to go 5 days a week but due to school and work
   I've been going less days. I lift so I can stay in shape and healthy.
